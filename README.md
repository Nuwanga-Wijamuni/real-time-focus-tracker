A real-time monitoring system that uses computer vision to analyze your focus and attention during work or study sessions. This tool provides actionable insights into your work patterns, helping you understand when you're most productive and when you're prone to distraction.

## ‚ú® The Dashboard in Action

The system culminates in a comprehensive Grafana dashboard that visualizes your focus data in real-time, providing both a live snapshot and historical trends of your attention levels.

## üåü Key Features

* **Real-time Head Pose Estimation:** Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to accurately track the yaw, pitch, and roll of your head from a webcam feed.
* **Multi-State Focus Classification:** Intelligently classifies your state into categories such as "Focused," "Looking Down," "Distracted - Looking Left/Right," and more.
* **Live Monitoring with Prometheus:** All metrics, from raw head angles to classified focus states, are exposed to a Prometheus time-series database for robust data collection.
* **Interactive Grafana Dashboard:** A rich, pre-configured Grafana dashboard visualizes:
    * Your focus state over time.
    * A pie-chart distribution of time spent in each state.
    * A live graph of your head pose angles.
* **Containerized & Reproducible:** The entire application stack (FastAPI, Prometheus, Grafana) is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for a simple, one-command setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Application:** Python, FastAPI
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, MediaPipe
* **Orchestration:** Docker, Docker Compose
* **Metrics & Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
* **WebSocket Communication:** For real-time data streaming from client to server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The data flows through a simple yet powerful pipeline:

`[Webcam] ‚û°Ô∏è [Client-side JS] ‚û°Ô∏è [FastAPI WebSocket] ‚û°Ô∏è [Python CV Logic] ‚û°Ô∏è [Prometheus Metrics] ‚û°Ô∏è [Grafana Dashboard]`

1.  A client-side application captures video frames from your webcam and streams them over a WebSocket.
2.  The FastAPI backend receives each frame, processes it using the MediaPipe library to determine head pose angles.
3.  The angles are analyzed to classify the current focus state.
4.  Key metrics are updated and exposed on a `/metrics` endpoint.
5.  Prometheus scrapes this endpoint periodically to collect the data.
6.  Grafana queries Prometheus to populate the live dashboard.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Getting the tracker up and running on your local machine is simple.

### Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/real-time-focus-tracker.git](https://github.com/your-username/real-time-focus-tracker.git)
    cd real-time-focus-tracker
    ```

2.  **Run the application stack:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    This command will build the FastAPI application image and start all three services (the app, Prometheus, and Grafana) in the background.

## üíª Usage

Once the services are running, you can access the different components of the system:

1.  **Start your client application** to begin streaming webcam video to the WebSocket endpoint at `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws`. The focus analysis will begin immediately.

2.  **View your Grafana Dashboard:**
    * URL: `http://localhost:3000`
    * Login: `admin` / `admin`

3.  **Explore Prometheus:**
    * URL: `http://localhost:9090`
    * You can run queries directly here (e.g., `focus_state`).

4.  **Access the API Docs:**
    * URL: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## üîÆ Future Development & Roadmap

This project has a strong foundation for many exciting new features, including:

* **Continuous "Focus Score":** Implement a 0-100 score instead of discrete states for a more nuanced view of attention.
* **Blink & Drowsiness Detection:** Use eye aspect ratio (EAR) to track blink rate and detect signs of user fatigue.
* **Session Tracking:** Add functionality to start/stop "work sessions" to compare focus across different tasks and times of day.
* **Grafana Alerting:** Configure alerts to get notified after a prolonged period of distraction, reminding you to take a break or refocus.
